# Other Scripts

## Temp Understand Logic
This script is meant as an after-step after the solution under the NER-approach. Assuming that the words describing the dataset are understood/tagged in the question, it uses a BM25 algorithm to attribute these tags to the right dataset.

This script is completely at zero and there could be much thought be put into this. Maybe it is better to use the entire question to attribute the right dataset? And right now it uses not only te dataset-title but also the description in the metadata to attribute it righly.

## Flask script
Is here to later easily implement this into a server solution. The socketio logic is already there to build something based on it.
