# Creative Challenge, NLP-Hackathon, Uni Berne 24th/25th March

## Problem description
It is not always easy to get the required statistical information in the shortest possible time. The data and information are not only spread vertically over different federal lev-els. They are also spread within these federal levels horizontally over different offices and even there sometimes over different sites/channels with different formats. Looking for the needle in the haystack looks comparably easy next to that. 
Further, statistical information is not always easy to find, even with the help of search engines, because they follow an indexing logic that does not index all available re-sources (be it applications or files).
The background of a more difficult search of facts, data and methodological explana-tions is also a risk for democratic processes: The harder it is for the average citizen to find the information, the easier it is to spread fake news. 
Therefore, the Statistical Office of the Canton of Zurich, together with other organiza-tions, would like to develop a Swiss Statistical Bot (STATBOT.CH), which would pro-vide data and statistical information directly and quickly across all organizations. A pro-ject application between CORSTAT (regional statistical offices of Switzerland) and the Federal Statistical Office is underway, and clarifications are underway within the Can-ton of Zurich.

## The aim of the Challenge with «creative character»
According to our understanding, there are two large components for such a statistical bot. On the one hand, there is the «understanding of the question», and on the other hand, there is the data query. In this challenge, we would like to focus on the first part: 
Primary aim: To find a way, to extract the most important information from a question, in order to be able to work with the content further down the pipeline. 
Secondary aim: To train a useful model for this “information extraction”. 

## Possible solutions

## Data
All publicly available data and metadata by the Statistical Office of the Canton Zurich is available under the following JSON: https://www.web.statistik.zh.ch/data/zhweb.json
But the data can of course also be expanded: All the data from opendata.swiss is rele-vant (primarily data from statistical offices). 
The github-repo is available under following link: 
https://github.com/statistikZH/statbot
You can also find there the folder “documentation” with the most recent version of our thoughts and script-desciptions.
