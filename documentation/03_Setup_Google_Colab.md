#Setup Google Collab

Here we are going to describe how to set up a work environment for you.

We prepared a google collab so that you can clone it to your google drive, install all the dependencies, and start coding.

Of course you do not have to use it or to base your approach on our code. We only thought to provide you as much support as possible, if it is of use to you at all.
